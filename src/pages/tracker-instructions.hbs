  <title>Bike Bus Beacon Instructions</title>
</head>

<body style="margin-left:20px; max-width:500px;">
  <h2 id="bike-bus-beacon-instructions">Bike Bus Beacon Instructions</h2>
  <p>When you&#39;re (physically) within the map area, you can test the beacon
    by going to the link below on your phone. Before you click that link,
    please read all of these instructions:</p>
  <p>When you open the beacon link, your device should prompt you to share
    your location with the website. Make sure you say yes, or the beacon
    won&#39;t be able to track you. From then on, whenever the beacon web page
    is visible on your phone screen, a dot will show up on the tracker map
    showing your location.</p>

  <h3>
    The Tracker Link
  </h3>
  <p>Since anyone who opens the beacon url will update the tracker, I
    recommend not distributing it widely (or at all) beyond the person who
    will be running it.
  </p>
  <p>If the link is ever compromised, let me know and I&#39;ll change it.</p>
  <h3>Setup</h3>
  <p>
    <em style="color:red;">The beacon will only track you when it&#39;s
      visible on screen.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    Set your phone not to automatically go to sleep or dim the screen. On an
    iPhone, that&#39;s in Settings under
    <strong>Display and Brightness</strong>
    &gt;
    <strong>Auto-Lock</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>Mounting the phone running the beacon on your bike with a phone mount is
    a great way to ensure that the screen is always on. It also helps you keep
    the bus on schedule if you&#39;re up front.</p>
  <p>Make sure your phone is well-charged.</p>

  <p>Don&#39;t dox yourself! Don&#39;t run the beacon until you&#39;re away
    from home, ideally at the starting point of the bus. If you do test the
    beacon at home, turn off the beacon as soon you&#39;re done to erase your
    location (see
    <em>Stop Tracking</em>
    below).
  </p>

  <h3>
    The Ride
  </h3>
  <p>The tracker will be most accurate if the person running the beacon is
    riding at the front of the bus.</p>

  <h3>
    Stop Tracking
  </h3>
  <p>You can shut down the beacon at any time by un-checking the &quot;Publish
    my location&quot; box. It may take a few seconds for the map to update. Be
    sure to do this after the ride!</p>

  <h3>Troubleshooting:</h3>
  <p>If for some reason the beacon&#39;s stopped updating, try reloading the
    page. On an iPhone, you can also try the steps above.</p>
  <p>You can always tell whether the beacon is updating by comparing the
    current time to the timestamp next to the last transmitted coordinates.
    The picture below shows what that looks like. The coordinates currently
    read &quot;0, 0&quot; because I&#39;m testing on my computer.

      src="/images/beacon_example.png" />
  </p>
  <p>If you have an iPhone and the beacon is unable to request your current
    location, you'll be prompted to do the following: open your settings app,
    go to
    <strong>Privacy &amp; Security</strong>
    &gt;
    <strong>Location Services</strong>
    &gt;
    <strong>Safari Websites</strong>, then choose
    <strong>While Using the App</strong>.
